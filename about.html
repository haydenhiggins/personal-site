  <p><b>Media:</b> I was a 2013-2014 Atlantic Media Fellow, working with the research and new products wing of <i>National Journal</i> and writing several articles for The Atlantic online. That fall, along with two friends I co-founded <a href="730dc.com">730DC</a>, a daily email newsletter that connects Washingtonians with the city, its communities, and with one another. As a freelance writer I've written about anti-kidnapping training for paranoid travelers, cultural appropriation in rock music, a second wave of sabermetrics in baseball, the biological appeal of bad boys, and more. I am an editor at <a href="https://www.themorningnews.org">The Morning News</a> where I contribute to our beloved headlines newsletter and produce <a href="https://themorningnews.org/article/2020-the-year-that-was-and-wasnt">our year-end roundups</a>.</p> 
  <p><b>Climate:</b> In 2014 I joined US Climate Plan, a predecessor organization to the Sunrise Movement, focused on catalyzing political will for federal climate policy with a focus on young people. As an organizer I participated in pathbreaking efforts protesting Keystone XL in Congress, divesting Washington DC from fossil fuels and passing a comprehensive clean energy law, brokering off-the-books conversations on carbon pricing, and pressing the EPA to strengthen the Regional Haze Rule. In 2015 I joined <a href="wri.org">World Resources Institute</a> as a writer and media specialist, editing our <a href="wri.org/insights">Insights blog</a>, prepping <a href="https://www.wri.org/stories-to-watch">presentations for senior staff</a>, producing our <a href="https://www.wri.org/podcasts">podcast</a> and pitching journalists our cutting-edge research. In 2020 I hopped over to lead communications for our <a href="wri.org/finance">Finance Center</a>, with research tracks covering international financial institutions, China's Belt and Road Initiative, sustainable investing, and climate finance.</p>
