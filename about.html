<div class="panel">
  <p><p>I was born in Florida, spent a chunk of childhood in North Carolina, grew up in California and returned to North Carolina for college. After working for a year in San Francisco, I moved to Washington, DC. In the past few years I've spent more time in Seattle, WA with my partner's family.</p>
  <p>Since 2013 I've published 730DC, a daily email newsletter that connects Washingtonians with the city, its communities, and with one another. In addition to constant coverage of what it's like to live in the nation's capital, as a freelance writer I've written about anti-kidnapping training for paranoid travelers, cultural appropriation in rock music, a seocond wave of sabermetrics in baseball, the biological appeal of bad boys, and more. I am an editor at <a href="www.themorningnews.org">The Morning News</a> where I contribute to our beloved headlines newsletter, write our year-end roundup and more.</p> 
  <p>In my career I've been constantly engaged with my two professional interests, media and climate advocacy. Following my stint as an Atlantic Media fellow in 2013-2014, I joined US Climate Plan, a predecessor organization to the Sunrise Movement, focused on catalyzing young people around federal climate policy. As an organizer I participated in pathbreaking efforts protesting Keystone XL in Congress, divesting Washington DC from fossil fuels and passing a comprehensive clean energy law, brokering off-the-books conversations on carbon pricing, and pressing the EPA to strengthen the Regional Haze Rule. In 2015 I joined World Resources Institute as a writer and media specialist, editing our Insights blog, prepping presentations for senior staff, producing our podcast and pitching journalists our cutting-edge research. In 2020 I hopped over to lead communications for our Finance Center, with research tracks covering international financial institutions, China's Belt and Road Initiative, sustainable investing, and climate finance.</p>
