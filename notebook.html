    <article><h3>While the world is not yet plain</h3>
    <img src="image00000735.jpeg" alt="The market on North Capitol and Lincoln St NE." style="width:300px;height:300px;">

    <p>Every cigarette turns a page in a book of blank pages.</p> 

<p>Here I am again, waiting for inspiration. I palm a lighter, walk out the basement escape, into the summer sun, and fish half a Spirit from its hiding place in the cleats an old roommate left on the porch. I notice the bright green Nikes every time I walk in the door. They have been there since March.</p>

<p>I’m out of ideas, which can be a desperate place to be for a job applicant, a lover seeking attention, anyone looking for something to happen for them. Like a sorority girl hyperventilating over an empty social calendar, I’m thinking it’s time to do something rash.</p>

<p>From the north side of the unit block of Q Street Northeast, the south side appears oddly flat and painted, and because the rest of the city slopes southward toward the Anacostia nothing appears in the sky behind the varicolored rowhouses except a unanimously teal-blue sky. The day will be hot; Washington wears humidity like a knockout wears a spritz of sweet perfume. (If you are not careful either will put you to sleep.) The unkempt yard encroaches impolitely on the one white plastic lawn chair we have—an aggressively rural touch—so I stay on the stoop. It’s hard to light the stub without burning my nose, and I almost cough to death laughing at the idea of walking around with a snout browned by idiocy.</p>

    <p>I am an amateur, an initiate, new to the cool desperation of waiting.</p>

<p>I inhale, and decimate myself. To maintain discipline, Roman commanders would kill a tenth of the centurions if a division failed to do its duty. I make a classic mistake of logical confusion, the effect for the cause, when I take the poison. Atonement for my sins, perhaps. (If my karmic account is at zero, and I initiate my own pain, is my next punishment voided, a tax credit for the cosmos?)</p> 

<p>A boy chases a ball down the hill; the ball, like everything else, only trying to go where it is wanted. That’s what I don’t know: where am I needed, where am I wanted? I yearn for something to box me in so at least I can know where the walls are, and smash—or transcend—or even know them. I can hardly even face the full street; too many possibilities. In need of a smaller world, I close my eyes.</p>

    <p>Even in darkness I am hounded by impatient suitors.</p>

<p>I want to flip ahead in the script of my life, hoping for the plot to thicken. We’re all waiting to be pulled into something: Mary gets a message, Luke chances on two escaped droids, and Harry—well, Hagrid turns up. Things happen. In lieu of that, I let my mind off-leash.</p>  
 
<p>The leaves we burn in self-pity grow on alluvial plains, flattened by the onslaught of wind, water, and time. The sun, whose rays provide the energy for the plant’s lilting upward grasp, slouches towards silence as it lazily exhausts itself.</p>

<p>Our sun, beloved worshipped sun, never will supernova; it will swallow Earth before it retires for quiet stasis, a white dwarf in long contemplation of the suffering it birthed.</p> 

<p>For a long time—as a child, really—I thought heat death meant the death of the universe by heat, heat as flame, fire and brimstone become full. I might not have been so confused if instead the phenomenon were dubbed the death of heat: the exhaustion of our world’s presumably finite supply of entropy. A whisper not a bang.</p> 

<p>Curlicuing smoke signifies the approach of stillness. I wonder whether the wisps of smoke might be read, like tealeaves or lines on a palm, for a clue to the future.</p> 

<p>It is nice to feel the jagged edge of each brick on my bared back. The bricks were once smooth and new; they will, someday, be smooth and old. The most random arrangement will smooth itself over time. They will be eroded by the fractal waves of a rising sea or molten by the lapping heat of a sun swollen with the third-order implications of a thousand explosions of thermonuclear solar plasma, the fluid dynamics of which expert practitioners don’t even pretend to understand.</p> 

<p>Or they will be worn down by my millionth defeated slouch. For now, though, they have texture.</p>

<p>Our world is a hiccup in a quiet torrent, an ugly burp of brightness and right angles in an otherwise bland universe. Wherever there is order—three rocks stacked, the information coded in DNA, in complex sugars—it exists as a fluctuation in the probabilistic ledgers, a lotto ticket to existence, most of all an account to be drawn down carefully. Humans marshal always against disorder. Separating the wheat from the chaff is our great anti-entropic crusade in idiomatic form, but don’t we also crave its opposite, the stochastic jolt? Crops cultivated, the leaves harvested, the paper rolled, all so here comes the ash.</p> 

<p>What we burn accelerates the world towards no contrast: the elegant geometry of the bonds, locked howsoever they are, now broken for a high, the form of their energy dissipated—their organization fled—never to light another scene. We hasten our efforts to oblivion. Grease the tracks and hurtle the cart on in its singular course. Electrons seek their base state. I wish my own way home were so clear.</p>

<p>Across Q Street, a woman howls, puts her head back and howls, and calls to a dog that definitely isn’t there. Her coats hang like refrigerator doors, her shoulders slumping with the weight. When she pitches her head back to howl, her cap stays on her head even at an improbable angle, heavier than wind, her cap redder than sunlight in childhood. That heat death I mentioned: it means an end to the difference of things, the contrast and the color.</p> 

<p>There’s an analogy, perhaps a misleading one, to be drawn to the dulling of senses as we age. In a concrete sense, the human body is degraded by signal; tinnitus, notably, is the literal sound of ear hairs decaying, the ghost of a 4000-Hz vibration felt one time too many.</p>

<p>Even the inputs we can weather corrupt. Muscles strengthen, but only after tearing. Their repair requires nutrition, protein and calories, the digestion of which produces, in time, the degradation of the human body.</p> 

<p>I lost my glasses yesterday, and as I myopically biked home I felt myself enter, again and again, a field of static. As I age, the world as my eyes report it will lose sharpness as my vision declines. Shapes will agglomerate, lose signal. Any of us, in time, will naturally enter a state that is the inverse of locked-in syndrome: though capable of a response, we will never see or hear or smell the prompt we might have been responding to.</p>

<p>In John Gardner’s Grendel, a Sartrean dragon offers small solace: “Half of suffering: things fade.”</p>

<p>When we smoke, we do so waiting, more often than not: for a friend to arrive, for a stroke of genius, for a worldly pain to pass.  In our waiting burn the wick of the world. Reshuffle the deck, smoke another one, just pass two minutes, two measly minutes, and who knows what will turn up.</p> 

<p>I don’t discern any patterns of augury in the roughness of the brick, nor in the unanswering disdain of the glowering street. But I won’t wait around for a better signal—“happens,” I know, is the most seductive word in the Anglo-American lexicon.</p> 

<p>The reentry to being, Celan’s Atemwende, breath-turn. I feel for the grain of the moment, Dasein, welcome its infinite textures. I am glad that God for now has not made the rough plain, that he has not yet taken the crooked places away from us and made them straight.</p><br></article>

  <article><h3>letter to the generations</h3>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I am writing, grandfather, from a balcony overlooking the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in Magdalena state, in Colombia. It&rsquo;s a place I can barely say I&rsquo;d read about before visiting, but it is beautiful. There are toucans, parrots and more hummingbirds than you can shake a stick at. They say there are more birds here than anywhere else in the world. It is as green as the American South and maybe even a bit less humid, during this, the dry season. If you can believe it, January and February are their summer, even though they&rsquo;re above the equator, because for the rest of the year it rains, it rains without cease from May to September or so and while the rest of the northern hemisphere bakes here they bathe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">You have no reason to be thinking about this place. You&rsquo;ve had the flu, my sister told me&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to tell you, she texted&mdash;and while things are looking up, you and I both know the jig&rsquo;s nearly up. So it should not surprise you that I am thinking of you, nor strike you as unbalanced.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There&rsquo;s no WiFi here. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know what that is; I am hardly sure myself. But, in any case, there is no internet here, and so while I write I&rsquo;m accompanied by the same six minutes of a jazz song, &ldquo;Like It Is&rdquo; by Yusuf Lateef, recorded in 1968. I don&rsquo;t know if you ever listened to jazz. I know you liked big band music, swing music, that you danced the square in a barn with Eleanor Roosevelt in the late thirties, when she was touring the country to keep morale up in the middle of the Depression. When you were that age you&rsquo;d been sent from your family&rsquo;s home to an uncle or cousin who could feed you, you told us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">I&rsquo;m drinking beer here on this balcony (it&rsquo;s dark now), wondering what mockery of a line could be drawn between you and me. I don&rsquo;t even know if you ever drank beer. The only time you went to the tropics, this far south at all, would have been during the fighting at Attu -- or so I imagined as a child who though all Pacific warfare had been on jungle islands like Guadalcanal, before I realized Attu was practically Arctic, the westernmost island in the desolate Aleutian chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">You told me the men drew lots to see who would clear the Japanese tunnels, that after throwing a grenade down it would be one man with a pistol and a torch. My dad said you never told him that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">You did tell us many times about the notorious woman. You always used that phrase, one of many roundabout ways you employed over the years to address subjects that weren&rsquo;t always strictly up to the fearsome level of courtesy and politesse effected by my grandmother. You got your job because the old guy ran off with a notorious woman, and they needed someone right away. You happened to be there. Getting a job was a lot easier back then. You sold fertilizer and pesticide up and down the corridor from Virginia to South Carolina. I doubt the company still exists, it must have been consolidated. I wonder if you&rsquo;d been born now, knowing what we know, if you&rsquo;d still sell that stuff. But it&rsquo;s a silly question, because you&rsquo;re so clearly who you are as a result of the times that molded you. It makes me wonder how my times have shaped me, in what ways I&rsquo;ll seem strange or alien to the generations I leave behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Of course I don&rsquo;t have but the one grandfather, Grandaddy in the familial parlance. The other one was bad before he was gone and gone before he was dead. It&rsquo;s by default you&rsquo;re my favorite, and if there were stiffer competition perhaps I&rsquo;d hold a couple issues in harsher light. But for now I see your playfulness in mine. You are philosophical without pretension. I can&rsquo;t say the same for myself&mdash;after all, you have the advantage of never having been to college&mdash;but it is something to admire.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Is it a modern condition, that each of us know a world incommensurate with the one our forefathers navigated? That they make but never inhabit a present, a&nbsp;present, given for our benefit but entirely ignorant of our own preferences and ways of being? I don&rsquo;t know. It is strange and I&rsquo;m not sure I like it, this dislocation, because when you go I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say that my father and then me and then my son will take your place. You lived an age we will never see again. From birth to death your life is a catalogue of new appliances, household chores or jobs eliminated: the refrigerator took away the milkman. The radio and television took away the paperboy. The vacuum took away the broom and mop. The first gift my father got you, he told us recently, was a microwave. That symbol of the nuclear age, the portent of atomic doom forestalled, tamed into this magic kitchen box...only for the microwave to enable decades of reheated dinners, the saddest American innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Thank you for all that you&rsquo;ve done to get me to this place. I am not saying I know why I&rsquo;m here or what I&rsquo;ll do with myself, but from the sandy shores of Wilmington, to the dinner tables in Charlotte, if we hardly traveled it didn&rsquo;t mean we didn&rsquo;t go anywhere. You and all my family are always with me. </p><br></article>
